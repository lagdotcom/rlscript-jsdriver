For this year's [RoguelikeDev does the Complete Roguelike Tutorial](https://old.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/vhfsda/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/), here's my entry, written in a language I'm creating specifically for the purpose.

## Getting started

If you just want to play the game, open up `docs/index.html`. If you want to build from scratch, use the following invocation:

```sh
npm i                   # fetch dependencies
npm run grammar         # this builds the parser grammar
npm run ctest           # this compiles week1.rl
npm run lint            # this makes the code look nicer :)
npm run dev             # this bundles the game into one JS file
```

## Technical Details
